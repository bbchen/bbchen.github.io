At the beginning of the year, I always would like to ask myself the following questions:

- What I have accomplished for the last year?
- What I would like to accomplish for the new year?
- What I did not quite do right in the past yar?
- How I am going to accomplish more in the new year?

When I ask myself the above questions, I feel very guilty for what I haven't done and what I could have done.

This is called the new year's resolution. A lot of people often perform reflection in the new year and set plans for the freshly new year.
