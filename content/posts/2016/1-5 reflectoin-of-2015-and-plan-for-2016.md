At the beginning of the year, I always would like to ask myself the following questions:

- What I have accomplished for the last year?
- What I would like to accomplish for the new year?
- What I did not quite do right in the past yar?
- How I am going to accomplish more in the new year?

When I ask myself the above questions, I feel very guilty for what I haven't done and what I could have done.

This is called the new year's resolution. A lot of people often perform reflection in the new year and set plans for the upcoming new year.

**First thing first, what I have accomplished for the year of 2015**:

- Received positive news for my first NSF grant
- Taught my first course: Mineralogy
- Gave an invited talk at the AGU fall meeting
- Renovated my large volume press laboratory, now housing four big presses for pressurecooker-like work.

**What I have not accomplished and what are under my own expectation in the year of 2015**:

- Weak publication. I should have written more papers, rather than proposals.
- Procrastination -- always wait for the last moment to finish my work, which actually made my life quite stressful.
- Lack of motivation of exercising and becoming healthier. After I purchased the parking permit, I stopped biking to work. And my body weight significantly increased. My body mass index (BMI), for the first time, falls into the lower end of the overweight range.
- Spent little time with family, especially kids. Even at night, I worked in my office. However, the productivity is quite bad. In other words, the imbalance of life style really gave me hard time in focusing on my work.

**So what is the new year's resolution for myself?** In the year of 2016, I am planning to establish some good habits and overcome the bad habits one by one. 

- Read more books, not only books in my research field, but some general topic books. Reading more good books makes one live wise. Read the books in the [Book Reading List]({filename}/pages/book-list.md).
- Write routinely. Everyday, spend 30 minutes and write at least 700 words. Do not check how good the writing is. Just sit down and start to write. Remember, the *3R* principals of effective writing: Revise, revise and revise. You can always have the opportunity to revise your articles.
- Overcome (probably not that easy, but I will try my best) procrastination. Always set the deadline 2-3 days earlier and work towards the deadline.
- Establish a good habit every six weeks. See [Habit List]({filename}/pages/habits.md).
- Run 3 times a week. This can be done in the morning or in the afternoon.

**And most importantly, what is the new year's resolution for my family?** Family is what I value the most important part of one's life. I am blessed that I have a nice family, with two little and lovely kids. In the new year, I am planning to accomplish the following:

- Read to the kids.
- Give them a decent and memorable vacation to the family.
- Spend more time with wife and kids.
- Learn to cook nutritious and healthy breakfast for the family.
- Be a role model for the kids.

There are always more things I would like to accomplish. Let me start from small things first, one after another. And I believe more will be accomplished by the end of the year. I am writing more reflections in this personal blogs to keep track of the changes I made and things I finished.

I believe my life will become better if I start to change now on an incremental basis.
