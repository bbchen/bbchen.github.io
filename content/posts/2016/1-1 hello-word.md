> Change will come; may you have the wisdom and courage to adapt -- Robert Hazen

**Hello World!** Aloha from Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. My screen name is bbchen. I lives in Honolulu, Hawaii with my wife and two little kids, where I write, read, and run.

This is the first post from [Zen Life](http://bbchen.github.io), a blog maintained by myself. I will post my thoughts, writings, and anything I found useful to this blog. If you would like to contact me, feel free to [twitter](http://twitter.com/bbchen) or [email me](mailto:bbchen@gmail.com).

As a note to myself in this "***Hello World!***" message, I would like to form the following writing and reading habits in the new year:

- **Writing**: I am going to write on average one blog post (at least 700 words) every 2-3 weeks to record my life and keep myself on track.
- **Reading**: I am going to read one book per month. See my [Book Reading List]({filename}/pages/book-list.md), which will be updated routinely.

If you find anything useful in my website, feel free to share them.
