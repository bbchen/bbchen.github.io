## About Me
Bin Chen is an Assistant Researcher in Mineral Physics and Experimental Petrology at Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, University of Hawaii at Manoa.

The focus of my research is to understand the physics and chemistry of Earth and planetary interiors through direct examination of material properties under high pressure-temperature conditions using a wide spectrum of techniques available in synchrotron and neutron facilities and in-house laboratories. Currently I am working on a project concerning the deep carbon cycle in the Earth’s interior with a focus on carbon in Earth’s core.

My research takes a two-pronged approach: using the multianvil apparatus for sample syntheses and high pressure-temperature measurements on large volume samples and the diamond anvil cell for determination of elastic and acoustic properties, combining with laser, X-ray and microanalytical techniques.
