This site is a DIY project to put in practice what I learn in my web development education journey. 

I'm currently using a [static site generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) made with [Go](http://www.golang.org) called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Hugo takes content written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and blends it with a set of templates that combine HTML and Go code, producing a static site that I then deploy to the public web via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). 

For layout and styling, I am using a responsive framework called [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com), together with a [custom style sheet](../../css/style.css) to style some HTML elements, classes and IDs.

I keep track of changes to my site with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com), and store my [source files](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) in a [Github](http://www.github.com) remote repository.

I do most of my work from the command line, on a Linux terminal emulator called Git Bash that comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).

For coding, I use either [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).
