I am an Earth scientists, focusing on deep Earth research. This page lists what I am currently doing for my life and research.

- [Book Reading List](/book-list) -- list of books that I have read and am currently reading
- [Habits](/habits) -- list of habits that I am currently sticking to, following the [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/) principals.

This page was inspired by the awesome [Derek Sivers](http://www.sivers.org/nowff).
