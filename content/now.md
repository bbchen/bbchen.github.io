These days I spend most of the time on my job, as a Product Marketing Manager for Latin America at a Fortune 500 company. 

I spend most of my free time learning front end web development, through online courses at Treehouse, Codecademy and Coursera. I also recently enrolled in the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co). 

Other than that, I am an avid soccer fan, and usually catch some good games on the weekends, especially if my favorite team, River Plate, is playing. 

This page was inspired by the awesome [Derek Sivers](http://www.sivers.org/nowff).
