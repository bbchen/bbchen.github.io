I want to tell a story about a geophysicist from CalTech. I don't know him quite well, but I met with him when I was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology. I first met him when I gave a talk on the thermal conductivity of ice under high pressures. Prof. Don Anderson was on the front row of the room. Since then, I met him in the hall way.
