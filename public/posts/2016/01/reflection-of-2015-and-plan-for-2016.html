    <h1 class="title">Reflection of 2015 and Plan for 2016</h1>
    
    
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>At the beginning of the year, I always would like to ask myself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What I have accomplished for the last year?</li>
<li>What I would like to accomplish for the new year?</li>
<li>What I did not quite do right in the past yar?</li>
<li>How I am going to accomplish more in the new year?</li>
</ul>

<p>When I ask myself the above questions, I feel very guilty for what I haven&rsquo;t done and what I could have done.</p>

<p>This is called the new year&rsquo;s resolution. A lot of people often perform reflection in the new year and set plans for the upcoming new year.</p>

<p><strong>First thing first, what I have accomplished for the year of 2015</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Received positive news for my first NSF grant</li>
<li>Taught my first course: Mineralogy</li>
<li>Gave an invited talk at the AGU fall meeting</li>
<li>Renovated my large volume press laboratory, now housing four big presses for pressurecooker-like work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I have not accomplished and what are under my own expectation in the year of 2015</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weak publication. I should have written more papers, rather than proposals.</li>
<li>Procrastination &ndash; always wait for the last moment to finish my work, which actually made my life quite stressful.</li>
<li>Lack of motivation of exercising and becoming healthier. After I purchased the parking permit, I stopped biking to work. And my body weight significantly increased. My body mass index (BMI), for the first time, falls into the lower end of the overweight range.</li>
<li>Spent little time with family, especially kids. Even at night, I worked in my office. However, the productivity is quite bad. In other words, the imbalance of life style really gave me hard time in focusing on my work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So what is the new year&rsquo;s resolution for myself?</strong> In the year of 2016, I am planning to establish some good habits and overcome the bad habits one by one.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read more books, not only books in my research field, but some general topic books. Reading more good books makes one live wise. Read the books in the <a href="{filename}/pages/book-list.md">Book Reading List</a>.</li>
<li>Write routinely. Everyday, spend 30 minutes and write at least 700 words. Do not check how good the writing is. Just sit down and start to write. Remember, the <em>3R</em> principals of effective writing: Revise, revise and revise. You can always have the opportunity to revise your articles.</li>
<li>Overcome (probably not that easy, but I will try my best) procrastination. Always set the deadline 2-3 days earlier and work towards the deadline.</li>
<li>Establish a good habit every six weeks. See <a href="{filename}/pages/habits.md">Habit List</a>.</li>
<li>Run 3 times a week. This can be done in the morning or in the afternoon.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And most importantly, what is the new year&rsquo;s resolution for my family?</strong> Family is what I value the most important part of one&rsquo;s life. I am blessed that I have a nice family, with two little and lovely kids. In the new year, I am planning to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read to kids every day.</li>
<li>Give them a decent and memorable vacation to the family.</li>
<li>Spend more time with wife and kids.</li>
<li>Learn to cook nutritious and healthy breakfast for the family.</li>
<li>Be a role model for the kids.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are always more things I would like to accomplish. Let me start from small things first, one after another. And I believe more will be accomplished by the end of the year. I am writing more reflections in this personal blogs to keep track of the changes I made and things I finished.</p>

<p>Change will come; may you have the wisdom and courage to adapt &ndash; Robert Hazen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe my life will become better if I start to change now on an incremental basis.</p>
