      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I always would like to ask myself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I have accomplished for the last year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I would like to accomplish for the new year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I did not quite do right in the past yar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I am going to accomplish more in the new year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask myself the above questions, I feel very guilty for what I haven&amp;rsquo;t done and what I could have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called the new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. A lot of people often perform reflection in the new year and set plans for the upcoming new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First thing first, what I have accomplished for the year of 2015&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received positive news for my first NSF grant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught my first course: Mineralogy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave an invited talk at the AGU fall meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renovated my large volume press laboratory, now housing four big presses for pressurecooker-like work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I have not accomplished and what are under my own expectation in the year of 2015&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak publication. I should have written more papers, rather than proposals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procrastination &amp;ndash; always wait for the last moment to finish my work, which actually made my life quite stressful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of motivation of exercising and becoming healthier. After I purchased the parking permit, I stopped biking to work. And my body weight significantly increased. My body mass index (BMI), for the first time, falls into the lower end of the overweight range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent little time with family, especially kids. Even at night, I worked in my office. However, the productivity is quite bad. In other words, the imbalance of life style really gave me hard time in focusing on my work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is the new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution for myself?&lt;/strong&gt; In the year of 2016, I am planning to establish some good habits and overcome the bad habits one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more books, not only books in my research field, but some general topic books. Reading more good books makes one live wise. Read the books in the &lt;a href=&#34;{filename}/pages/book-list.md&#34;&gt;Book Reading List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write routinely. Everyday, spend 30 minutes and write at least 700 words. Do not check how good the writing is. Just sit down and start to write. Remember, the &lt;em&gt;3R&lt;/em&gt; principals of effective writing: Revise, revise and revise. You can always have the opportunity to revise your articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcome (probably not that easy, but I will try my best) procrastination. Always set the deadline 2-3 days earlier and work towards the deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a good habit every six weeks. See &lt;a href=&#34;{filename}/pages/habits.md&#34;&gt;Habit List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run 3 times a week. This can be done in the morning or in the afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And most importantly, what is the new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution for my family?&lt;/strong&gt; Family is what I value the most important part of one&amp;rsquo;s life. I am blessed that I have a nice family, with two little and lovely kids. In the new year, I am planning to accomplish the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read to kids every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them a decent and memorable vacation to the family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time with wife and kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to cook nutritious and healthy breakfast for the family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a role model for the kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are always more things I would like to accomplish. Let me start from small things first, one after another. And I believe more will be accomplished by the end of the year. I am writing more reflections in this personal blogs to keep track of the changes I made and things I finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change will come; may you have the wisdom and courage to adapt &amp;ndash; Robert Hazen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe my life will become better if I start to change now on an incremental basis.&lt;/p&gt;
