Dr. Bin Chen has joined the faculty of the [Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology](http://www.higp.hawaii.edu) in the [School of Ocean and Earch Science and Technology](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu) as a tenure-track Assistant Researcher since January 1st, 2014. 

His principle research interest lies in understanding the physics and chemistry of Earth and planetary interiors through direct examination of material properties under high pressure-temperature conditions using a wide spectrum of techniques available in synchrotron and neutron facilities and in-house laboratories. His research takes a two-pronged approach: using the multianvil apparatus for sample syntheses and high pressure-temperature measurements on large volume samples and the diamond anvil cell for determination of elastic and acoustic properties, combining with laser, X-ray and microanalytical techniques. Recently Bin has endeavored to understand the deep carbon cycle in the Earth's interior with a focus on carbon in Earth's core.
